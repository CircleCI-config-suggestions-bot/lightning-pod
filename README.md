As of 20 Feb 2023: I began minimizing examples in lightning-pod in favor of creating a clean template. See [enhancement/clean](https://github.com/JustinGoheen/lightning-pod/tree/enhancement/clean) for a sense of what will be provided after that branch has been merged. Over the next week,`lightning-pod` will become a reusable template with minimal setup overhead. 

The previous version of lightning-pod with an end-to-end example now lives at [lightning-pod-example](https://github.com/JustinGoheen/lightning-pod-example). Going forward: that repo will be used to provide new examples of Lightning components and AI/ML methodologies.
